\chapter{Conclusion}
Based on the practical various experimentation of SNESL that has demonstrated good performance and time and space efficiency, this thesis has moved  the development of SNESL one step forward. 

The main contributions of this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Extension of the dataflow model of streaming to account for recursion. \\
	The challenge of supporting recursion is that it can cause an infinite increase on the dataflow network of the execution model.
	Our solution is to extend the target language to make sure that the dataflow graph will be completed dynamically during execution, but not grow infinitely, if proper usage  of the \wc instruction is provided in the program. 
	We have developed the implementation as two instrumented interpreters, an eager one with sufficiently large space  and a streaming one with a limited buffer,  to compare both results and costs. 
	Although without a formal proof, we have shown the possibility of termination preservation in our experiment, and provided some representative examples.
	The space usage from our experiment results also shows an increase proportional to the depth of the recursion. 
\item A formalization of the source and target languages and the correctness of the translation and work cost preservation.  \\
Formal semantics for the high-level NDP language can be found from previous related research, such as NESL and Proteus. However, none of them has given a formal semantics of the target language. 
This thesis has presented a formalization of the target language for a core subset of SNESL, and also demonstrated a plausible proof system for the correctness of translation and work cost preservation, as well as some other important properties of the language.
The work we have done in this thesis should lay out the possibility for a formal validation of the translation correctness and cost preservation for the full SNESL.
\end{itemize}

While investigating the solution to recursion, we have also touched some crucial, open problems in this streaming language,  such as streamability, scheduling, and deadlocks. 
We have explored a possibility of scheduling that can be as efficient and light as the one used in the previous work of SNESL, but also preserves the cost.

The future work on SNESL related to the scope of this thesis fall into the following two points.
\begin{itemize}
		\item Formalization of the streaming semantics of the target language. 
		The related work we have done in this thesis is only for its eager semantics, while the streaming semantics is also an area that has not been covered much yet.
		
	\item Schedulability.  As a streaming language taking care of both the time and space efficiency,  SNESL should be equipped with a type system or some static/dynamic analysis that can prevent a measure of problematic programs. The user may expect that, at least for a streamable program, deadlock will not happen. This is maybe the most challenging problem by thus far.
